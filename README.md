# PyClash
A first open source Python 3.9 Clash of Clans Server for version 6.253!

## Client
To connect to your server, you need a custom client. Here the only solution is to use a [precompiled client](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zJ3-GbflMd1gMLV89qGG9Ij_4M5KmcP9/view?usp=sharing)
Just edit the IP in the Frida-Gadget config (```/lib/armeabi-v7a/libxeon.config.so```)

### Friendly reminder
The server is in a very early state. Right now, it is NOT recommended to run this on a production environment. Please not open issues about missing features, i'm well aware of this.
